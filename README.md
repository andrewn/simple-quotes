SimpleQuotes
==

A simple web service for fetching the a random SimpleNote note tagged with "quote".

Set your email and password as environment vars when you start the service, like this:
  QUOTE_EMAIL="me@email.com" QUOTE_PASSWORD="myreallygoodpassword" coffee app.coffee

A random quote should then appear at /quotes/random

This is mainly a thing for me to try our coffeescript and node.js.
